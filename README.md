# AMULETY

Amulety stands for Adaptive imMUne receptor Language model Embedding Tool.
It is a Python command line tool to embed B-cell receptor (antibody) and T-cell Receptor amino acid sequences using pre-trained protein or antibody language models. So far only BCR embeddings are supported but TCR support is planned for future releases. The package also has functionality to translate nucleotide sequences to amino acids with IgBlast to make sure that they are in-frame.

Integrated embedding models are:

- antiBERTy
- antiBERTa2
- ESM2
- Custom models

## Installation

You can install AMULETY using pip:

```bash
pip install amulety
```

## Usage

To print the usage help for the AMULETY package then type:

```bash
