## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `AMULETY` for local development.

1. Fork the `AMULETY` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/amulety.git
```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv or conda. Assuming you have conda installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

```
$ conda create -n amulety python=3.11
$ cd amulety/
$ pip install -e .
```

4. Create a branch for local development:

```
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that the linting tests pass:

```
$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now pre-commit will run automatically on `git commit`!.
If you want to run it manually run

```
$ pre-commit .
```

6. Check that the tests pass locally, and add tests if necessary.

```
pytest .
```

7. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11, and for PyPy. Check [https://github.com/immcantation/amulety/actions](https://github.com/immcantation/amulety/actions) and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
4. Automatic GitHub actions CI tests will also run the tests, all the tests must pass before merging the PR.

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`).

Then update the package version e.g. by using `bump2version` or manually and open a PR to the `main` branch.
GitHub actions will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
