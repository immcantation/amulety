# Amulety Documentation

Amulety stands for Adaptive imMUne receptor Language model Embedding tool for TCR and antibodY.
Amulety is a Python command line tool to embed B-cell receptor (BCR), also termed antibodies in their secreted form, and T-cell receptor (TCR) amino acid sequences using pre-trained general protein or specific immune receptor language models. The package supports both BCR and TCR embeddings. The package also has functionality to translate nucleotide sequences to amino acids with IgBlast.
